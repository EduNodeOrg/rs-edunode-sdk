rs-edunode-sdk: Rust SDK for EduCerts by EduNode.org
This repository provides the Rust Software Development Kit (SDK) for the EduCerts, a decentralized digital certificate issuing and verification system. EduCerts is designed to be leveraged on the Soroban Smart Contract platform.

# Features
Minting: This SDK provides an easy interface to mint (or issue) EduCerts on the Soroban platform. This allows educational institutions to issue verifiable digital certificates with ease.
Verification: The SDK also provides functionalities for verifying the authenticity of issued EduCerts. This helps to ensure the credibility and verifiability of educational certificates.
Interoperability: The SDK is designed to be  compatible with the Soroban Smart Contract platform. However, we also plan to integrate other protocols that allow us to provide seamless integration and ease of use for our users.
Safety: Built with Rust's safety guarantees, the SDK ensures the security and integrity of all operations concerning EduCerts.

# Requirements
- Rust 1.54.0 or newer
- Soroban Smart Contract platform account

# Installation
To add the rs-edunode-sdk to your package, add the following to your Cargo.toml:

<code>[dependencies]
rs-edunode-sdk = "0.1.0"
</code>
Then run <code>cargo build</code> to download and compile the package.


# Usage
After adding the SDK as a dependency, import it using:
<code>
extern crate rs_edunode_sdk;
</code>

# Minting Certificates
To mint a new EduCert:

<code> let mut edunode = rs_edunode_sdk::EduNode::new(YOUR_SOROBAN_ACCOUNT);
let certificate = edunode.mint_certificate("Certificate ID", "Recipient Name", "Issuing Institution", "Course Name", "Issue Date", "Expiry Date");
</code>

# Verifying Certificates
To verify an existing EduCert:
<code>
let verification_result = edunode.verify_certificate("Certificate ID");
</code>
